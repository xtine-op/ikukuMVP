| FR001          | Dashboard Overview                 | As a user, I want to see a summary of my poultry farm (total chickens, deaths, batches) at a glance. | The dashboard displays the total number of chickens across all batches, total number of chicken deaths, and total number of batches currently active.         |
| FR002          | Accessing Batches Section          | As a user, I want to view and manage my chicken batches easily from the dashboard.              | A "Batches" button on the dashboard navigates the user to a list of all their chicken batches, with options to view, edit, or add new batches.               |
| FR003          | Creating a New Batch               | As a user, I want to create a batch with details like type, age, and quantity.                  | Users can fill out a form to add a new batch, specifying batch name, chicken type (broiler, kienyeji, layer), age, and number of chickens.                   |
| FR004          | Viewing Batch Details              | As a user, I want to view detailed information about a specific batch.                          | Tapping a batch displays its full details including current age, initial count, chicken deaths, and updates from farm records.                               |
| FR005          | Editing Batch Information          | As a user, I want to update batch information if I make a mistake or the situation changes.     | The system allows users to edit batch data (e.g., age or chicken count), with appropriate validation to maintain consistency.                                |
| FR006          | Accessing Farm Store Section       | As a user, I want to manage my feeds, vaccines, and medicines from one place.                   | The "Farm Store" button on the dashboard navigates to a categorized inventory (feeds, vaccines, others), showing current stock and allowing new entries.     |
| FR007          | Adding Items to Farm Store         | As a user, I want to add new feed, vaccine, or medicine records to my store.                    | A form allows users to enter the name, category, quantity, and date of entry.                                                                                 |
| FR008          | Viewing Inventory Items            | As a user, I want to view all inventory items I’ve added for easy tracking.                     | Each inventory category shows a list of items with name, quantity, and stock status.                                                                          |
| FR009          | Daily Farm Record Entry            | As a user, I want to enter daily farm updates like mortality, feed usage, and vaccinations.     | A "Farm Reports" button leads to a form to record data for selected batches: date, number of dead chickens, feed used, vaccine given, and production notes.  |
| FR010          | Viewing Submitted Farm Reports     | As a user, I want to see the reports I’ve submitted over time for each batch.                   | A "View Farm Reports" button navigates to a date-based view, where users can browse daily records by date and batch, and view detailed entries.              |
| FR011          | Aggregated Reporting               | As a user, I want to see overall trends in my farm activities.                                  | The system aggregates farm report data (e.g., feed used, mortality rates) and displays monthly summaries or charts in the reports section.       |
| FR012          | Navigation from Dashboard          | As a user, I want quick access to all major features from the home dashboard.                   | The dashboard includes buttons for Batches, Farm Store, Farm Reports, and View Farm Reports, allowing one-click access to each feature.                      |
